            A Tailwind CSS preset is a pass-through object to style PrimeVue, the components are not aware of Tailwind in core as the utility classes are injected via <i>pt</i>. This makes the architecture flexible as another CSS library like UnoCSS
            or Bootstrap can be used instead of Tailwind.

            The release bundle contains two built-in presets; <b>lara</b> and <b>aura</b>. In the future, more presets are planned e.g. for Material Design. The presets are implemented for you to use as a base to build your own, you may use them as
            they are or use them as reference when creating your own design. A preset can only for a single component or multiple, visit the <NuxtLink to="/gallery">Gallery</NuxtLink> to view the community driven presets. Releases of presets are not
            published to NPM as copy-paste approach is a more suitable strategy for easier customization instead of an imported module from node_modules.

            Presets are reactive, as a result changing the configuration reskins the entire UI suite. This allows switching the design system at runtime e.g. from Material Design from Google to Fluent of Microsoft with a single line instead of
            rewriting the application with another UI library.
